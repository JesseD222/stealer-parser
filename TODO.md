- [ ] Batch processing for multiple archives
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Statistical analysis and trend visualization
- [ ] Integration options for security tools

### Phase 6: Image Processing & Testing
- [x] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - No placeholder images were detected in the project
  - Clean design without external image dependencies
- [x] Frontend functionality testing - Web interface successfully built and deployed
- [x] End-to-end workflow validation - Complete user flow implemented
- [x] Performance and security testing - Secure file handling and validation

### Phase 7: Final Integration & Deployment
- [x] Final build and optimization - Production build successful
- [x] Documentation and user guides - Comprehensive WEB_README.md created
- [x] Commit and push changes to repository - Changes committed and pushed
- [x] Production deployment preparation - Docker configuration included

## ðŸš€ PROJECT PHASE 2: ASYNC PROCESSING & DATABASE SCALING

### Phase 8: Asynchronous Processing Architecture
- [x] Implement async/await pattern throughout the parsing pipeline
- [x] Add Redis-based job queue for background processing
- [x] Create database models for high-performance storage
- [x] Implement connection pooling and transaction management
- [x] Add batch processing for large archives

### Phase 9: High-Performance Database Integration
- [x] Design optimized database schema for millions of records
- [x] Implement SQLite with WAL mode for development
- [x] Add PostgreSQL support for production scaling
- [x] Create efficient indexing strategy for fast queries
- [x] Implement database migrations and versioning

### Phase 10: Advanced Analytics & Performance
- [x] Add real-time streaming analytics
- [x] Implement data aggregation and caching
- [x] Create advanced search and filtering capabilities
- [x] Add bulk operations and data deduplication
- [x] Performance monitoring and optimization

### Phase 11: Production Scaling Features
- [x] Implement horizontal scaling with worker processes
- [x] Add database sharding and partitioning capability
- [x] Create monitoring and alerting system
- [x] Implement backup and disaster recovery foundations
- [x] Load testing and performance benchmarking tools
